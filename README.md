# Svelte Chat

A community-driven project for learning and improving development skills through weekly feature challenges.

## Project Overview

Our goal is to build an app collaboratively, implementing a new feature each week. All developers will work on the same feature, and the best implementation will be merged into the main app through a voting process.

## Getting Started

1. Become a member of our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/6J3f7NkETs) and participate on the weekly meetings.
2. Send me your email or github link via DM to join our GitHub organisation, my Discord name is [.fx4](https://discordapp.com/users/405406280140849162) 
3. Clone the main repository: `https://github.com/Learn-Svelte-Together/svelte-chat.git`

## Weekly Workflow

1. **Feature Announcement**
   - Each week, a new feature will be announced on the [features channel](https://discord.gg/eUs9veBEua)

2. **Branch Creation**
   - Create a new branch from `develop` for your feature implementation.
   - Use the naming convention: `feature/featureIndex-discordName`
   - Example: `git checkout -b feature/1-patrick`

3. **Implementation**
   - Develop the feature on your branch.
   - Open a pull request (PR) to the `develop` branch.

4. **Code Review**
   - Everyone is invited to review everyones PRs.
   - Provide constructive feedback and suggestions.
   - Be open to feedback on your own PR and make necessary changes.

5. **Voting**
   - Once the implementation period ends, voting will open.
   - Review all PRs and vote using the designated method (e.g., GitHub reactions).

6. **Merging**
   - The implementation with the most votes will be merged.
